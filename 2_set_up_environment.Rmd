## Remember to open the R Project!!! ##
## Install packages with renv

Fiddly hack to make sure rlang is up to date: 
```{r}
install.packages("rlang") # Confirm that rlang is up to date.
```

Set up renv, the package manager for this project: 
```{r}
install.packages("renv")
renv::activate()
```

Use renv to restore packages from the lockfile: 
```{r}
renv::restore(prompt = FALSE)
.rs.restartR() # restart R after package update
# This may take some time
```
